# IPAdressingCSharp

This repository demonstrates:

- some experiments with different data structures to store IP addresses (`uint`, `byte[]`, `string`)
- shows how to use the dotnet `IPAddress`-class : `System.Net.IPAddress` (just to make life a bit easier)
- some experiments with subnet-calculation (compare with e.g. http://jodies.de/ipcalc)
